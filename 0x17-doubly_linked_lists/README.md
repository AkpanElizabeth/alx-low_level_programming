Description
A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each containing a reference to the previous and next element in the sequence. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations at both the beginning and end of the list.

This repository contains several C files, each implementing different operations on doubly linked lists. The tasks covered in this project include:

0-print_dlistint.c: A function that prints all the elements of a doubly linked list.
1-dlistint_len.c: A function that returns the number of elements in a doubly linked list.
2-add_dnodeint.c: A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
3-add_dnodeint_end.c: A function that adds a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.
4-free_dlistint.c: A function that frees the memory allocated for a doubly linked list.
5-get_dnodeint.c: A function that returns the nth node of a doubly linked list.
6-sum_dlistint.c: A function that calculates the sum of all the data (integers) in a doubly linked list.
7-insert_dnodeint.c: A function that inserts a new node at a given position in a doubly linked list.
8-delete_dnodeint.c: A function that deletes a node at a given position in a doubly linked list.
